      <description>Background I extended the work of (Wu and Plantinga 2003) using R and certain equation modififications to investigate how the addition of a light rail line would influence a city.

However, city designs, have placed amenities in isolated suburban pockets, the abundance of roads have encouraged sprawl, and zoning laws have discouraged density.</description>
