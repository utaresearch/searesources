      <description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distributed water and energy technologies have the potential to reduce reliance on centralized infrastructures, household utility bills, and carbon footprints. Current adoption levels remain low because of issues such as long payback periods, limited consumer awareness, capital constraints, and resource intermittency challenges. In this study, we assess the ability of two system design concepts to improve the economics of distributed water and energy technologies, and ultimately encourage their broader adoption: (1) co-optimizing water and energy technology investments and operations, and (2) investing in community-scale rather than home-scale systems. We explore the benefits of these approaches by formulating a mixed-integer linear program for optimal system design and dispatch. Our case study applies this model to a neighborhood in Austin, Texas. Results show that distributed electricity and water production increase, and total cost decreases, when resources and demands are pooled at larger community scales. These community-scale systems make a wider range of technologies economically viable and enable greater asset utilization due to systems integration. The cost and carbon emissions reduction benefits of co-optimizing distributed water and energy investments are significant, especially at higher aggregation levels. While distributed water production alone tends to increase carbon emissions, complementing it with appropriate distributed electricity generation technologies can yield simultaneous economic and environmental benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Contributions of shared autonomous vehicles to climate change mitigation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract: The climate change impacts of the anticipated growth in shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) are highly uncertain due to competing mechanisms whose magnitudes are difficult to estimate. On the one hand, SAVs could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by driving more efficiently, avoiding traffic congestion, accelerating adoption of alternative fuel vehicles, and charging in alignment with renewable electricity generation. On the other hand, SAVs could induce more vehicle miles traveled (VMT) by lowering the time cost of travel and allowing non-drivers to travel more by car. In this study, we develop an energy system optimization model that integrates the electricity and transport sectors, computes endogenous technology adoption, and distinguishes SAVs from privately owned vehicles (POVs) to explore the contributions of SAVs to climate change mitigation. Our results show that widespread SAV adoption lowers costs and emissions, and that these desirable outcomes remain true even if SAVs induce double the VMT of the POVs they replace. SAVs dramatically accelerate the market penetration of electric vehicles. The environmental and economic benefits of this electrification trend are larger if electric SAV charging can be optimally aligned with renewable electricity generation. Especially in the short to medium term, SAV adoption can be a more impactful lever than a carbon tax for decarbonizing vehicle travel.&lt;/p&gt;
