      <description>We designed a spinning top that is novel, aesthetically pleasing, durable, spins well, and whose unique fan assembly can only be made using SLS. Our design incorporates a modular top system that allows for interchangeable designs to be attached to the universal base. We designed two UT-themed attachable tops, one that is a replica of the UT model tower and the other that is a replica of the UT seal. The universal base has wind turbine blades in its center so that air can be blown through it to keep it spinning even with a large top installed.</description>

      <description>We investigated how different Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques could be used to perform sentiment analysis on real user generated text data from the Sentiment140 dataset [1]. First we investigated an LSTM model before deciding on using the self-attention network code from [2] because of the possible speed and accuracy advantages. Our contributions included investigating how the training batch size and dropout rate affected the accuracy of the model and validating an existing model by reproducing it and using it with a different dataset.</description>

      <description>This post explores how to use Gurobi to solve more advanced LPs, MIPs, and QPs. I have written these using Gurobi as a solver and as the mathematical formulation software. This is a reproducible example if you have R Studio just make sure you have installed the correct packages.

      <description>Background This post explores how to markov chains work and how to visulaize them in R. I use a R package specifically designed to visualize markov chains. I also represent these markov chains using tables. This is a reproducible example if you have R Studio just make sure you have installed the correct packages.

      <description>Background I extended the work of (Wu and Plantinga 2003) using R and certain equation modififications to investigate how the addition of a light rail line would influence a city.
Cities have housed most of the human race since 2004 and as a result influence most of the individual, commercial, and industrial energy and GHG patterns. However, city designs, have placed amenities in isolated suburban pockets, the abundance of roads have encouraged sprawl, and zoning laws have discouraged density.</description>

      <guid>/blog/class_projects/austin-land-use/austin-land-use/</guid>
      <description>I compiled the land use of Austin by zoning and land use data. Furthermore, number of parking spaces and the square footage of those parking spaces by land use (single family homes, apartments and commercial buildings). Furthermore, I compared that square footage with the square footage actually in the buildings and the land area of the city of Austin. And then I used the building data I compiled to determine how much rooftop space Austin has and how much solar that could hold.</description>

      <description>Lab Agenda The SEAR lab is part of an innovation ecosystem that includes the RFID and Auto Identification and Data Science (RAID) labs where Dr. Jones Jr. serve as director, the Center for Stochastic Modeling, Optimization, and Statistics (COSMOS) where I serve as their Sustainability Lab Director, and the Pulsed Power Energy Lab.
Vision: The SEAR or Sustainable and Equitable Allocation of Resources Lab believes that by creating systems that properly allocate resources, we can sustainably, equitably, and resiliently meet society&#39;s needs for food, energy, and water while maintaining a high standard of living.</description>

      <description>Want to Join our Team ?Are you interested in the sustainability, equity and resilience of our food, water, electricity, energy transportation, industrial, and/or supply chain systems? Or are you interested in investigating and developing new technologies like microgrids powered by used EV batteries and solar panels, RFID enabled blockchains, and digital communication platforms that can aid with sustainability, equity, and resilience objectives? Do you think you can with the proper guidance and encouragement learn how develop mathematically rigorous frameworks that provide stakeholders with the insights they need to make sustainable, equitable, and resilient decisions under various uncertainties?</description>
